const TRANSLATION_RULES = `
Translating:
- Set "language" to the language the question is printed in: "ur" for Urdu, "en" for English.
- Put the same question in the other language in "translation" — English if the page is Urdu, Urdu if the page is English. Never change "text" itself.
- Translate the meaning as a teacher would set the same question to the other medium, not word by word. Keep every number, symbol, unit and proper noun exactly as it is.
- For an mcq, translate the choices too, into "options_translated", using the same labels in the same order as "options".
- If a question cannot be carried into the other language without changing what it tests — it is about grammar, spelling, poetry, or a passage in the printed language itself — leave "translation" out rather than forcing one.`

function prompt(exercisesOnly: boolean, translate: boolean): string {
  return `You are reading ${exercisesOnly ? 'pages of a textbook' : 'pages of an exam paper or question sheet'}. List every question printed on them.

Reproducing the text:
- Output the question exactly as printed, in its own script and language. Urdu stays in Urdu, Arabic in Arabic, English in English. Never translate, transliterate or romanise, whatever language this instruction is written in.
- Preserve mathematical notation using Unicode symbols such as √ π ≤ ≥ ≠ ∫ ² ³ ½ ° θ Δ.
- Do not correct spelling or grammar, do not rephrase, do not shorten, do not add words that are not printed.
- Never answer a question, and never invent one that is not on the page.

Classifying each question, in the "type" field:
- "mcq" — printed with a set of choices to pick from.
- "true_false" — asks whether a statement is true or false.
- "fill_blank" — has a blank, a dash or dots to complete.
- "short" — a few lines of answer: define, state, name, convert, solve one step.
- "long" — an essay, a proof, a derivation, or a question worth many marks.
Use the paper's own section headings when it has them ("Objective", "Short answer", "Attempt any five long questions") — they are more reliable than the wording of a single question.

For an mcq, put the choices in "options", each with the label as printed ("A", "a", "i", "١") and its text. If a question is not an mcq, leave "options" out.

Splitting — this matters more than anything else here:
- A question printed with enumerated parts — (i), (ii), (iii), or (a), (b), (c), or 1., 2., 3. — becomes ONE ENTRY PER PART. Always. A stem with six parts is six questions, not one.
- Carry the shared instruction into every part, so each one stands alone. "Find the value of x in each of the following:" over "(i) log₂ 1024 = x" becomes the single entry "Find the value of x: log₂ 1024 = x". Do this even when the part is meaningless without the stem — especially then.
- Do not put the part marker in the text. The bank numbers questions itself.
- The only exception is a part that needs another part's answer — "using your result from (i)". Those stay together as one entry.
- A bare marker on its own line — "(i)" with the question on the lines below it — belongs with the text that follows it, as one question.

Do not include the question's own number or label at the start of the text — "Q3.", "Qno: 4", "Question 5:", "3.", "٣". The bank numbers questions itself when it prints them, and a number carried over would be printed twice. Sub-part markers inside a question that stays whole are kept.

Leave out entirely:
- Letterheads, school names, logos, page numbers, headers and footers.
- Instructions and rubrics: "Attempt any five", "Time: 2 hours", "Total marks: 75", "All questions carry equal marks".
- Answer keys, marking schemes and worked solutions.
- Names of sections on their own.
${exercisesOnly ? '- Lesson text, worked examples, definitions and summaries. Take questions ONLY from exercise, review, practice, activity and مشق sections — the parts that ask the student to do something.\n' : ''}
Put the printed marks in "marks" when the page shows them for that question, as a number. Leave "marks" out when the page does not say.

Say which chapter each question belongs to, in "chapter", as "Chapter 5". Work it out from whatever the page shows, in this order of preference:
- A chapter heading on the page: "Chapter 5", "Unit 5", "باب ٥".
- The running head along the top or bottom of the page, which usually repeats the chapter.
- The exercise number: "Exercise 5.1" and "مشق ٥٫١" both mean Chapter 5.
Use the digits as a plain number even when the page prints them in Urdu or Arabic numerals, so "باب ٥" becomes "Chapter 5". If nothing on the page says which chapter it is, leave "chapter" out rather than guessing — the app carries the chapter forward from the pages before it.
